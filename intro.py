# Declare variables
a = 20
b = 5

# Apply 4 arithmetic operators
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b   # since b is not zero

# Print results
print("The value of a is:", a)
print("The value of b is:", b)
print("Addition (a + b) =", a)
print("Subtraction (a - b) =", )
print("Multiplication (a * b) =", )
print("Division (a / b) =",)
